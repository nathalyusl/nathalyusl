Hello! I am Diana, I am from Ecuador, currently studying to become a data scientist, any help is appreciated. I graduated in foreign trade and the idea is to combine these two disciplines. I am interested in image recognition, if we are on the same tune I like to connect.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on freelancer
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning data science 
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on AI
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with R statistics
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about cats
- âš¡ Fun fact: I love nature, a lover of animals, especially dogs and cats. In my free time I practice contemporary dance, sing and I'm learning to play the guitar, which is a big challenge because I have small hands and sometimes I don't advance the chords.

Curious fact
My country is located in Latin America also known as "Middle of the World" latitude 0Âº 0 â€² 0 â€³. Ecuador is very diverse since it has 4 natural regions: Coast, Sierra, Oriente and Insular Region (Galapagos Islands), the magic of here is that in 48 hours you could visit all the regions, and be charmed heart_eyes with all its culture, architecture, flora , fauna and without a doubt its climate.
